#### **Phase 2A: CLAUDE.md File Testing (Anthropic Best Practice)**

**Objective**: Test Claude's automatic context loading from CLAUDE.md files

**Preparation**:
```bash
# Create test workspace for CLAUDE.md testing
mkdir -p /tmp/claude-setup-test
cd /tmp/claude-setup-test
```

**Test Cases**:

1. **Basic CLAUDE.md File Creation and Testing**
   ```bash
   # Create a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file
   cat > CLAUDE.md << 'EOF'
# Project Context for Testing

## Bash Commands
- `npm run build`: Build the project
- `npm run test`: Run the test suite
- `python manage.py runserver`: Start development server

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use 4 spaces for indentation in Python
- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax, not CommonJS
- Prefer f-strings in Python for string formatting
- Always include docstrings for functions

## Testing Instructions
- Run `pytest tests/` for unit tests
- Use `npm run test:integration` for integration tests
- Always test locally before committing

## Repository Conventions
- Branch naming: feature/description, fix/description, hotfix/description
- Prefer merge commits over rebase for features
- Always squash commits in pull requests

## Development Environment
- Requires Python 3.9+
- Use virtual environment: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Known Issues and Warnings
- Ignore the "XYZ deprecated" warning during build - it's harmless
- Database migrations must be run manually in production
- The test suite requires at least 8GB RAM to run completely

## Important Notes
IMPORTANT: Always run the full test suite before deploying
YOU MUST check code formatting with `black .` before committing
EOF

   # Test that Claude recognizes and uses the CLAUDE.md content
   ./claude-no-proxy "What are the coding style guidelines for this project? What commands should I use to build and test?"
   
   # Test project-specific knowledge
   ./claude-no-proxy "How should I name branches in this repository? What are the known issues I should be aware of?"
   
   # Test development workflow understanding
   ./claude-no-proxy "I want to set up the development environment. What steps should I follow?"
   ```

2. **Hierarchical CLAUDE.md Testing (Monorepo Scenario)**
   ```bash
   # Create parent directory CLAUDE.md
   mkdir -p parent-project
   cd parent-project
   
   cat > CLAUDE.md << 'EOF'
# Parent Project Guidelines

## General Repository Rules
- All subprojects must follow the same testing standards
- Use the shared CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Common dependencies are managed at the root level

## Monorepo Structure
- `/frontend/` - React application
- `/backend/` - Python API server
- `/shared/` - Common utilities and types
EOF

   # Create subdirectory with specific CLAUDE.md
   mkdir frontend
   cd frontend
   
   cat > CLAUDE.md << 'EOF'
# Frontend Specific Guidelines

## Commands
- `npm start`: Start development server on port 3000
- `npm run build`: Create production build
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint

## Frontend-Specific Rules
- Use TypeScript for all new components
- Follow React Hooks patterns
- Use styled-components for styling
EOF

   # Test that Claude picks up both parent and child context
   ./claude-no-proxy "What's the structure of this monorepo? What are the frontend-specific commands and the general repository rules?"
   ```

3. **CLAUDE.local.md Testing (Personal Configuration)**
   ```bash
   # Create personal, non-tracked configuration
   cat > CLAUDE.local.md << 'EOF'
# Personal Development Preferences

## My Preferred Commands
- `make dev`: My custom development script
- `./scripts/quick-test.sh`: Personal testing script

## Personal Notes
- Remember to use the staging database for testing
- My API key is stored in ~/.config/project/api_key
- I prefer verbose output for debugging
EOF

   # Test personal configuration recognition
   ./claude-no-proxy "What are my personal development preferences? What custom commands do I have available?"
   ```

4. **CLAUDE.md Auto-generation Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test the /init command
   # Note: This would need to be tested interactively
   echo "Test /init command functionality by running: ./claude-no-proxy and then typing /init"
   ```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Claude automatically reads and incorporates CLAUDE.md content
- ✅ Hierarchical CLAUDE.md files work correctly (parent + child)
- ✅ Personal CLAUDE.local.md files are recognized
- ✅ Claude provides project-specific responses based on CLAUDE.md content
- ✅ The /init command generates appropriate CLAUDE.md files

#### **Phase 2B: Extended Thinking Modes Testing (Anthropic Best Practice)**

**Objective**: Test Claude's extended thinking capabilities with different thinking budgets

**Test Cases**:

1. **Basic Thinking Mode**
   ```bash
   # Test standard "think" trigger
   ./claude-no-proxy "Think about the best approach to implement a caching system for a web application. Consider performance, scalability, and maintainability."
   
   # Test planning with thinking
   ./claude-no-proxy "I need to refactor a large Python codebase. Think about the steps I should take and potential risks."
   ```

2. **Progressive Thinking Budgets**
   ```bash
   # Test "think hard" for more complex analysis
   ./claude-no-proxy "Think hard about the architectural trade-offs between microservices and monolithic design for a financial application with strict compliance requirements."
   
   # Test "think harder" for deeper analysis
   ./claude-no-proxy "Think harder about implementing a distributed consensus algorithm. Consider Byzantine fault tolerance, network partitions, and performance implications."
   
   # Test "ultrathink" for maximum thinking budget
   ./claude-no-proxy "Ultrathink about designing a secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving social media platform. Consider all technical, legal, and ethical implications."
   ```

3. **Thinking in Planning Workflows**
   ```bash
   # Test thinking in the explore-plan-code workflow
   ./claude-no-proxy "I want to add real-time notifications to my web app. First, think about the different approaches and trade-offs. Don't code anything yet, just plan."
   
   # Test thinking for complex debugging
   ./claude-no-proxy "Think about why my application might be experiencing memory leaks. Consider all possible causes and debugging strategies."
   ```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ "think" triggers provide more thoughtful responses
- ✅ Progressive thinking budgets ("think hard", "think harder", "ultrathink") allocate more computation
- ✅ Thinking modes improve planning and analysis quality
- ✅ Complex problems receive deeper consideration with higher thinking budgets

#### **Phase 2C: Tool Allowlist Management Testing (Anthropic Best Practice)**

**Objective**: Test permission management and tool allowlist customization

**Test Cases**:

1. **Default Permission Behavior**
   ```bash
   # Test default conservative permissions
   ./claude-no-proxy "Create a new file called 'test-permissions.txt' with some content"
   # Should prompt for permission
   
   ./claude-no-proxy "Run the command 'ls -la' to show current directory contents"
   # Should prompt for permission
   ```

2. **Interactive Permission Management**
   ```bash
   # Test /permissions command (interactive testing required)
   echo "Test /permissions command by running: ./claude-no-proxy and then typing /permissions to see and modify allowed tools"
   
   # Test adding specific tools to allowlist
   echo "Test adding Edit tool: /permissions add Edit"
   echo "Test adding specific git commands: /permissions add Bash(git commit:*)"
   echo "Test adding MCP tools: /permissions add mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate"
   ```

3. **CLI Flag Permission Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test --allowedTools flag for session-specific permissions
   ./claude-no-proxy --allowedTools Edit "Create and edit a file called 'test-allowed.txt' with sample content"
   
   # Test multiple allowed tools
   ./claude-no-proxy --allowedTools Edit,Bash "Create a file and then list the directory contents"
   ```

4. **Safe YOLO Mode Testing** (Use with extreme caution!)
   ```bash
   # Create isolated test environment first
   mkdir -p /tmp/yolo-test && cd /tmp/yolo-test
   
   # Test dangerous skip permissions mode (only in isolated environment)
   echo "WARNING: Test --dangerously-skip-permissions only in isolated container:"
   echo "./claude-no-proxy --dangerously-skip-permissions 'Create multiple test files and run basic commands without prompting'"
   ```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Default behavior requests permissions for potentially dangerous operations
- ✅ /permissions command allows interactive allowlist management
- ✅ --allowedTools flag works for session-specific permissions
- ✅ Safe YOLO mode works but shows appropriate warnings
- ✅ Granular control over specific tools and command patterns

#### **Phase 2D: Workflow Pattern Testing (Anthropic Best Practice)**

**Objective**: Test Anthropic's recommended workflow patterns

**Test Cases**:

1. **Explore-Plan-Code-Commit Workflow**
   ```bash
   # Create test project
   mkdir -p /tmp/workflow-test && cd /tmp/workflow-test
   echo "# Test Project" > README.md
   echo "import sys\nprint('Hello World')" > main.py
   git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"
   
   # Step 1: Explore (don't code yet)
   ./claude-no-proxy "Read the files in this directory and understand the current project structure. Don't write any code yet, just explore and understand what's here."
   
   # Step 2: Plan (use thinking mode)
   ./claude-no-proxy "Think about how to add a logging system to this Python project. Create a detailed plan but don't implement anything yet."
   
   # Step 3: Optional - Save the plan
   ./claude-no-proxy "Create a file called PLAN.md with the logging implementation plan you just developed."
   
   # Step 4: Code (implement the plan)
   ./claude-no-proxy "Now implement the logging system according to the plan. Add proper logging to the main.py file and create any necessary configuration."
   
   # Step 5: Commit
   ./claude-no-proxy "Commit the logging implementation with an appropriate commit message."
   ```

2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workflow**
   ```bash
   # TDD Workflow testing
   mkdir -p /tmp/tdd-test && cd /tmp/tdd-test
   
   # Step 1: Write tests first
   ./claude-no-proxy "I want to implement a Calculator class with add, subtract, multiply, and divide methods. Write comprehensive tests for this class first. This is test-driven development, so don't implement the actual class yet, just the tests."
   
   # Step 2: Confirm tests fail
   ./claude-no-proxy "Run the tests to confirm they fail since we haven't implemented the Calculator class yet. Don't write any implementation code."
   
   # Step 3: Commit tests
   ./claude-no-proxy "Commit the test files with an appropriate message."
   
   # Step 4: Implement code to pass tests
   ./claude-no-proxy "Now write the Calculator class implementation to make all the tests pass. Don't modify the tests themselves. Keep iterating until all tests pass."
   
   # Step 5: Commit implementation
   ./claude-no-proxy "Once all tests pass, commit the Calculator implementation."
   ```

3. **Visual Development Workflow** (if image capabilities available)
   ```bash
   # Visual development testing
   mkdir -p /tmp/visual-test && cd /tmp/visual-test
   
   # Create a simple HTML page for visual testing
   cat > index.html << 'EOF'
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Test Page</title></head>
<body><h1>Hello World</h1><p>This is a test page.</p></body>
</html>
EOF
   
   # Test visual development workflow
   ./claude-no-proxy "I want to improve the styling of this HTML page. First, can you take a screenshot or describe how this page currently looks?"
   
   # If image upload is supported, test visual refinement
   echo "For visual development testing, provide Claude with design mockups and ask it to:"
   echo "1. Implement the design in code"
   echo "2. Take screenshots of results"
   echo "3. Compare with the target design"
   echo "4. Iterate until it matches"
   ```

4. **Codebase Q&A and Exploration Workflow**
   ```bash
   # Create a sample codebase for exploration
   mkdir -p /tmp/codebase-qa && cd /tmp/codebase-qa
   
   # Create sample files
   cat > auth.py << 'EOF'
import hashlib
import jwt
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class AuthManager:
    def __init__(self, secret_key):
        self.secret_key = secret_key
    
    def hash_password(self, password):
        return hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest()
    
    def create_token(self, user_id):
        payload = {
            'user_id': user_id,
            'exp': datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(hours=24)
        }
        return jwt.encode(payload, self.secret_key, algorithm='HS256')
EOF

   cat > api.py << 'EOF'
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from auth import AuthManager

app = Flask(__name__)
auth_manager = AuthManager('secret-key-123')

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username = request.json.get('username')
    password = request.json.get('password')
    # Authentication logic here
    return jsonify({'status': 'success'})

@app.route('/protected', methods=['GET'])
def protected():
    # Token validation logic here
    return jsonify({'data': 'protected content'})
EOF

   # Test codebase exploration questions
   ./claude-no-proxy "How does authentication work in this codebase?"
   ./claude-no-proxy "How do I add a new API endpoint?"
   ./claude-no-proxy "What security measures are implemented in the auth system?"
   ./claude-no-proxy "What improvements could be made to this authentication system?"
   ./claude-no-proxy "How would I add password reset functionality?"
   ```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Explore-plan-code-commit workflow produces better results than jumping straight to coding
- ✅ TDD workflow with tests-first approach works effectively
- ✅ Visual development workflow supports iterative design improvements
- ✅ Codebase Q&A provides helpful exploration and learning assistance
- ✅ Planning phases improve implementation quality

#### **Phase 2E: Optimization Techniques Testing (Anthropic Best Practice)**

**Objective**: Test optimization techniques for better Claude Code usage

**Test Cases**:

1. **Specificity in Instructions Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test vague vs. specific instructions
   # Poor example
   ./claude-no-proxy "add tests for the auth module"
   
   # Good example (more specific)
   ./claude-no-proxy "write a new test case for auth.py, specifically covering the edge case where a user attempts to login with an expired token. Include both positive and negative test cases and avoid using mocks where possible."
   
   # Test specific implementation instructions
   ./claude-no-proxy "look at how the existing API endpoints are implemented in api.py to understand the patterns. Then, following the same pattern, implement a new '/users' endpoint that returns a list of all users. Use the same authentication middleware and error handling patterns as the existing endpoints."
   ```

2. **Image and Visual Content Testing** (if supported)
   ```bash
   # Test image input capabilities
   echo "Test image input by:"
   echo "1. Taking a screenshot and pasting it into Claude"
   echo "2. Drag-and-drop image files into the terminal"
   echo "3. Providing file paths to images"
   
   # Create test images for file path testing
   echo "Create test visualization files and test Claude's ability to read and analyze them"
   
   # Test visual appeal instructions
   ./claude-no-proxy "Create a data visualization of sample sales data. Make sure the visualization is aesthetically pleasing and professional-looking for presentation to stakeholders."
   ```

3. **File Reference and Tab-Completion Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test file path completion (interactive test)
   echo "Test tab-completion by typing file paths with ./claude-no-proxy and pressing Tab"
   
   # Test explicit file mentioning
   ./claude-no-proxy "Please read and analyze the content of auth.py and api.py files in the current directory"
   
   # Test folder references
   mkdir -p tests config
   touch tests/test_auth.py config/settings.py
   ./claude-no-proxy "Look at the files in the tests/ and config/ directories and suggest improvements to the project structure"
   ```

4. **URL Fetching Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test URL reading capabilities
   ./claude-no-proxy "Please fetch and analyze the content from https://httpbin.org/json and explain what this endpoint does"
   
   # Test documentation reading
   ./claude-no-proxy "Read the Python requests library documentation from https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/ and explain how to handle authentication properly"
   
   # Test multiple URL processing
   ./claude-no-proxy "Compare the API design principles from these two sources: https://jsonapi.org/ and https://restfulapi.net/, then suggest best practices for our API"
   ```

5. **Course Correction Techniques Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test interruption and redirection (interactive test)
   echo "Test course correction by:"
   echo "1. Starting a complex task with Claude"
   echo "2. Pressing Escape to interrupt during execution"
   echo "3. Providing new directions or clarifications"
   echo "4. Using double-Escape to edit previous prompts"
   echo "5. Asking Claude to undo changes when needed"
   
   # Test plan-first approach
   ./claude-no-proxy "I want to refactor the authentication system to use OAuth2. Create a detailed plan first, but don't implement anything until I confirm the plan looks good."
   ```

6. **Context Management Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test /clear command usage
   ./claude-no-proxy "Analyze this large codebase and provide recommendations" # Large task
   # Then test: /clear
   ./claude-no-proxy "Now help me with a simple Python function" # Should have fresh context
   
   # Test context pollution scenarios
   ./claude-no-proxy "Read all files in this directory and keep them in context"
   ./claude-no-proxy "Now work on a completely different task - create a simple calculator"
   # Should demonstrate the need for /clear between unrelated tasks
   ```

7. **Checklists and Scratchpads Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test complex multi-step workflow with checklist
   mkdir -p /tmp/complex-task && cd /tmp/complex-task
   
   # Create multiple files with various issues
   for i in {1..10}; do
     echo "def function_$i():" > file_$i.py
     echo "    print('hello world'  # Missing closing parenthesis" >> file_$i.py
     echo "    return 42" >> file_$i.py
   done
   
   # Test checklist workflow
   ./claude-no-proxy "I have multiple Python files with syntax errors. First, create a checklist in a file called 'fixes_checklist.md' with all the files that need fixing and what issues they have. Then work through the checklist one by one, fixing each file and checking it off."
   ```

8. **Data Input Methods Testing**

- **Provider selection logic** - Test intelligent model routing, auto-detection, and fallback mechanisms
- **Tool format conversion** - Verify tool format translation (anthropic_tools ↔ openai_functions)
- **Error handling** - Test graceful degradation and recovery mechanisms
- **Parameter conversion** - Test cross-provider parameter mapping and optimization

**Critical Test Commands**:
```bash
# Test cross-provider format conversion
./claude-no-proxy --model claude-sonnet-4 --system "Expert engineer" --temperature 0.1 "Technical documentation with specific parameters"

# Test provider selection and model mapping
./claude-no-proxy --model sonnet "Confirm exact model mapping - should route to claude-sonnet-4"

# Test error handling and recovery
./claude-no-proxy --model invalid-claude-model "Test error handling"
./claude-no-proxy --model claude-sonnet-4 "Confirm recovery after error"
```
